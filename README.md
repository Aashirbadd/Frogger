To run the program, navigate to the directory on your computer to which the files are saved, through the terminal. Then, run command "make clean", then "make", and finally "./myProg".

Upon launching the program, users will be brought to the main menu. By default, the "start game" button will be highlighted. To start the game, press button "A" on the SNES Controller. Otherwise, press down on the D-Pad to navigate to the exit game button, and press "A" to exit game.

Upon starting the game, the player will be at the bottom of the screen, with their lives, moves, and time displayed at the bottom border of the screen. Each time the game is started, there will be power ups placed at random positions of the screen. The dark green block indicates the "freeze time" power up, and will freeze the time when the player collides with it. The sky blue block indicates the "car reduction" power up and reduces the number of cars on the screen.

Once the player reaches the top of the screen, a congratulatory message will be printed out in the terminal, the game will restart, and go back to the main menu. If the player loses the game (runs out of lives, time, moves) then there will be a message printed in the terminal informing them of this loss, and the game will be reset and go back to the start menu.

At any point during the game, the player can pause using the start button, and use the pause menu to either restart the game, or to exit the game and go back to the main menu. To go back to playing, they can simply press start again.
